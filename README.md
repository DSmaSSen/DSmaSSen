## üëã Hi!

### Welcome to my GitHub!

## ü§ì About me...

<details><summary></summary>

As my profiles says, my name is Daniel.
<br>I'm a 24 year old danish boy living in Odense, Denmark, currently studying for an AP Graduate in Computer Science ("Datamatiker" in danish).

Having been curious about the technical world since I was tiny man, I always thought I wouldn't be able to learn any of that magic!
<br>Typical, I know. But I got smarter...

Starting out by using MS Excel in creative ways;
<br>... I found my passion in creation and the satisfaction of writing good code,
<br>... I found my motivation in putting in the work and seeing results.
<br>Now I'm a student and I look forward to - some day - make coding a part of my job.

## üéí Where to next?

### Internship

<details><summary></summary>
    
Around January 2026 I am looking for a 3 month internship, as required by my education.
<br>As I'm still feeling new and curious, I don't have one specific direction I want to go.
<br>I personally see that as an oppotunity rather than a limitation, as it comes from curiosity. Also because I believe passion can be found in anything, if approached with an open mind.

### Job

<details><summary></summary>
    
Around June 2026 I should be finished with my education, and would of course love to find a job in the process.
<br>As mentioned above I am open minded an curious about what oppotunities I have.
